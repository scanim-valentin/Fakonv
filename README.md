# Fakonv
A tool to play fake conversations in a terminal.

# Preparation
You will need to create a text file containing all the replies from the fake conversation member(s), the delay between them and whether or not they are waiting for an answer.
The structure has to look like this:
```
[DELAY IN SECONDS](A)
[REPLY 1]
[DELAY IN SECONDS](A)
[REPLY 2]
[DELAY IN SECONDS](A)
[REPLY 3]
```
See example.txt. 

# Use
Simply run Fakonv.py and enter your file name.
